# OpenGLProject
Basically learning to make an OpenGL Game Engine. Will try and make a release with a minimum functioning version of OpenGL to use later.

First commit represents a basic OpenGL project that compiles. It may not be perfectly layout, but the best I could do with researched knowledge. Feel free to download that commit and give it a try. It should create a black window.

The direction of the project is learning rendering from a game designers point of view. Expect many tutorial projects before anything real.
